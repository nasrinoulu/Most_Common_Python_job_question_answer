# 1) What is Python? What are the benefits of using Python?
Python is a programming language with objects, modules, threads, exceptions, and automatic memory management. The benefits of pythons are that it is simple and easy, portable, extensible, build-in data structure, and it is open-source.

# How is memory managed in Python?
Python memory is managed by Python private heap space. All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap. The programmer does not have an access to this private heap, and the interpreter takes care of this Python private heap.
The allocation of Python heap space for Python objects is done by the Python memory manager. The core API gives access to some tools for the programmer to code.
Python also has an inbuilt garbage collector, which recycles all the unused memory and frees the memory and makes it available to the heap space.
